## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In the previous week, I had multiple exams and extracurricular events, so I did not have time to commit to this project.



## This Week's Plan

> For next week, I plan to begin to continue to familiarize myself with ReactJS by finding more tutorials online and trying to apply my skills with personal programs.
> I also plan to take a few Git tutorials. 
> I have no exams next week, so I am sure that I will have time to commit to the project. 


## Anything Blocking?

> The tutorial was not incredibly comprehensive, so I am a little concerned with applying my skills, but I think that beginning the project will help me practice what I have learned.
> We are not being given a lot of guidance as to what we should be doing in regards to the project; I will speak to Milena this week.
> Family Weekend
