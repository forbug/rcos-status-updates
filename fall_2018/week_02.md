## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In the previous week, I completed the ReactJS tutorial that Milena assigned our group.



## This Week's Plan

> For next week, I plan to begin to continue to familiarize myself with ReactJS by finding more tutorials online and trying to apply my skills with personal programs.
> I also plan to take a few Git tutorials. 

## Anything Blocking?

> The tutorial was not incredibly comprehensive, so I am a little concerned with applying my skills, but I think that beginning the project will help me practice what I have learned.
> I have many exams in the next few weeks, so I have not been able to commit as much time as I have wanted to the project.
