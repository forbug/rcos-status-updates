## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I had a lot of extra time this week, so I was able to research tutorials for ReactJS. This led me to a tutorial for JavaScript, since I have yet to learn much about that language, and I was able to take many notes about the basic concepts. 



## This Week's Plan

> For next week, I plan to begin to continue to familiarize myself with JavaScript and finish the tutorial so that I may continue onto the ReactJS portion of the tutorial.
> I also plan to take a few Git tutorials. 
> I plan to take the notes that I have from the tutorials and structure them into portions that may be formatted in our lessons.
> Finally, I plan to commit my notes to my directory.


## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing now!
