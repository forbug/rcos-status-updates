## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In the previous week, I was assigned to the curriculum development sub-group for our project. I also tried to become familiar with Git. 
> Outside of RCOS, I attended the Google Coding Competition. 



## This Week's Plan

> For next week, I plan to begin to familiarize myself with ReactJS, so that I may properly design the curriculum. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I have very little experience with ReactJS, so I am a little concerned about the amount of time that I may need to commit to this project in order for my contributions to be profitable, but I am looking forward to starting. 
> I am also very unfamiliar with Git and what it is, but I am working on developing my skills.
